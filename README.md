# RESTeasy
RESTeasy lets you focus on markup and styling by abstracting away all the boilerplate JavaScript for communicating with your REST API.

## Requirements
RESTeasy has absolutley zero dependencies, no jQuery needed.

RESTeasy uses modern JavaScript language features including Async/Await, map, fetch, and object destructuring. These are supported nativley by recent versions of Chrome and Firefox, but transpiling with babel is recommended to support other browsers.

## Demo
The demo folder contains a single page site demostrating usage of RESTeasy. You can open this in directly your web browser, no server required.

## Usage
Usage guide coming soon.
